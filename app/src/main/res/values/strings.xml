    <string name="bio">Hello, myself Aayushi and I graduated from IIT Roorkee.
        My programming journey started with C++, which led me to explore competitive programming, game development, and web projects.
I have worked on creating applications using React.js, Node.js, Django and MongoDB.
        I am also well-versed in data structures and algorithms.
        One of my achievements is a complete full fledged project built with the MERN stack.
        Right now, I am contributing as a software developer in a tech giant, focusing on Android development.
